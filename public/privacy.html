  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 15, 2024</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you connect your Epic MyChart account, we access your health information through patient-authorized FHIR APIs. This includes demographics, lab results, medications, conditions, and appointment history.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>Your health data is displayed in the application interface for your personal use. This is a prototype application for testing FHIR integration capabilities.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Currently, authentication sessions are stored temporarily in server memory and are not persisted to a database. Access tokens expire after 1 hour.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal health information with third parties. Your data is accessed solely for displaying it back to you within the application.</p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard HTTPS encryption for all data transmission. Access tokens are handled securely and are not logged or stored permanently.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to disconnect your Epic account at any time. You can revoke access through your Epic MyChart account settings.</p>

  <h2>7. HIPAA Compliance</h2>
  <p>This is a prototype application. For production use, we will implement full HIPAA compliance including encrypted storage, audit logging, and Business Associate Agreements.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page.</p>
